# Setting Up the Project

## Step 1: Create Project Files
- Create a folder for your project (e.g., `ResponsiveNavMenu`).
- Inside the folder, create the following files:
  - `index.html`
  - `style.css`
  - `script.js`

## Step 2: Install a Text Editor (Optional)
- Use any text editor you're comfortable with, such as:
  - Visual Studio Code (recommended)
  - Sublime Text
  - Notepad++

## Step 3: Test Your Setup
- Open the `index.html` file in a browser to confirm your project setup is working.
